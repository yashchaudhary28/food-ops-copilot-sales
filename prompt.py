def metadataExtractor_prompt(question: str, schema_json: str, fewshot: str, chat_history: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are a highly capable assistant trained to interpret natural language questions related to restaurant sales data 
and extract all essential components needed to generate accurate and optimized SQL queries for sales analytics.

Given the following:
- A **sales data schema** that includes for each column: its name, data type, description, sample values, 
  whether binning is possible, and a list of common aliases.
- A **natural language question** from the user about restaurant sales, payments, geographic performance, or tax analysis.
- Optional **few-shot examples**.

Your task is to analyze this input and extract the following metadata necessary to construct an effective SQL query:

1. **Data And Visualisation Relevance Check**
Determine whether the user's question is sales data/analytics related or a general conversation. Even if the question is visualisation related keep this as 1. This distinction is crucial to decide whether to generate an SQL query or respond in a conversational manner.

2. **Relevant Columns**  
   Identify which columns from the sales schema are necessary to answer the question. Use both column names and aliases to detect matches.
   Focus on: Brand, Outlet_Location, City, Payment_Type, Payment_Vendor, Sale_Date, revenue columns, tax columns.

3. **Question Intent**  
   Understand and summarize the core purpose of the question, such as:
   - Sales performance analysis (revenue, transactions)
   - Payment method analysis (online vs offline, vendor performance)
   - Geographic analysis (city/outlet performance)
   - Tax analysis (compliance, burden analysis)
   - Trend analysis (time-based patterns)
   - Brand comparison and ranking

4. **Date Interval**  
   If the question involves a specific time range (e.g., "in May 2025", "last month", "from June to July"), extract this interval clearly.  
   If no interval is mentioned, return null.
   
5. **Binning Logic**  
   If the question requires grouping numeric data into ranges (e.g., "group by transaction amount", "distribution of settlement total"), identify the relevant column(s) and suggest whether bins are required or not. 
   **Do Binning for only those columns which have the "binning_possible" value set to "Yes" in the table schema**
   Common sales binning scenarios: transaction amounts, customer group sizes (Pax), discount ranges.

6. **Payment Analysis Question**
    Whenever question is related to payment method analysis, vendor comparison, or digital payment adoption, always set the value "payment_question" to 1

7. **Chat History**
    Chat History will be provided to you to get the context of the question asked by the user

8. **Output Format**  
   Respond strictly in the following JSON structure:
   {{
     "data_related": 0 or 1
     "relevant_columns": [ "COLUMN_NAME_1", "COLUMN_NAME_2", ... ],
     "date_interval": "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD" or null,
     "binning_required": 0 or 1 
     "bins": ["COLUMN_NAME_1"],
     "payment_question": 0 or 1,
     "intent": "short description of what the question is trying to do"
   }}

Use the schema intelligently to resolve synonyms, detect temporal, geographic, financial, or categorical references, 
and determine what is needed to write the SQL query accurately.

    ##Role
    You are a **highly skilled BigQuery analyst**. Your task is to generate accurate and optimized **GoogleSQL** queries to answer questions **only using the specified table(s)**.
    
    ---

    ##Rules & Constraints
    
    ### 1.Table Usage
    - **ONLY** use the table(s) listed in the **TABLE_NAMES** section.
    - Do **not** invent or reference any other tables.
    - **DO NOT USE JOINS**. All logic must be derived **from a single table**.

    ---

    ### 2.Accuracy and Logic
    - Focus on **accurate column selection** and **precise filtering**.
    - Use the information listed under **Metadata Section**.

    ---

    ### 3.Percentage Calculations
    When calculating percentages:
    - **Numerator** = Count of filtered records based on question logic.
    - **Denominator** = Total relevant records (e.g., customers in filtered dataset).
    - Use this formula:
      (Filtered_Count / Total_Count) * 100

    ---
    
    Date Interval Handling Rule (CRITICAL):
        When the question asks for data from the "last N months", follow this logic:
        - Use CURRENT_DATE() to get today's date.
        - Subtract 1 month from the current date to get the last completed month.
        - Truncate it to the first day of that month using DATE_TRUNC(..., MONTH).
        - Then subtract N months from that to get the start date.
        - The end date should be the last day of the most recent completed month, which is obtained using:
          LAST_DAY(DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH))

        Example SQL logic for sales data:
        Sale_Date >= DATE_SUB(DATE_TRUNC(DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH), MONTH), INTERVAL N MONTH)
        AND Sale_Date <= LAST_DAY(DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH))

    ---
    
    Binning Rule (CRITICAL):
        - If binning is required for a column and specific bin edges are provided, you must use **only those edges**.
        - Do not infer or modify the bin edges.
        - Each value should be assigned to a bin using the given edges exactly.
        
        When **payment_question** = 0, follow the below logic:
        
        Example (given edges for transaction amounts): [100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]
        Binning Logic:
          - Bin 1: 100 <= value < 500 (Small transactions)
          - Bin 2: 500 <= value < 1000 (Medium transactions)
          - Bin 3: 1000 <= value < 2000 (Large transactions)
          - Bin 4: 2000 <= value < 5000 (Premium transactions)
          - Bin 5: 5000 <= value (High-value transactions)
          - Bin 6: value < 100 (precautionary bin for any unexpected small values)
        
        When **payment_question** = 1, focus on payment method analysis:
        
        Example for Payment Analysis:
        Group by Payment_Type and Payment_Vendor for insights like:
            - Online vs Offline payment adoption
            - Platform-specific performance (Zomato, Swiggy, UPI providers)
            - Digital payment trends and vendor comparison
            **No binning needed for payment analysis, use direct grouping**
    
    ---

    ##Date Handling (CRITICAL)
    - Use `EXTRACT()` for date operations:
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Sale_Date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM Sale_Date)
    - `Sale_Date` is already a valid **DATE** column.
    - **NEVER use** `PARSE_DATE` or other parsing functions.
    - **Avoid** date format conversions.
    - For time-based analysis, use Sale_Date for filtering and grouping.

    ---

    ##Numeric Formatting (CRITICAL)

    ### A. Monetary Conversions (for numeric calculations)
    - For sales revenue columns like `Basic_Amount`, `Net_Sale`, `Settle_Total`:
      - Values are already in INR, no conversion needed.
      - Use `ROUND(..., 2)` to round to 2 decimal places for display.
      - Store the rounded value **as a numeric alias** (e.g., `total_revenue_num`) **before formatting**.
      - **Use this numeric value for sorting or any further logic.**
    - For large amounts, optionally convert to lakhs by dividing by 100000.


    ### B. Final Output Formatting (for display only)
    - Apply the following **REGEXP_REPLACE logic only in the final SELECT**, to format the numeric value cleanly:
      REGEXP_REPLACE(
        FORMAT('%.2f', total_disbursement_crores_num),
        r'(\.*?[1-9])0+$|\.0+$',
        r'\1'
      ) AS total_disbursement_crores
    - This ensures output looks clean (e.g., 123.00 → 123, 123.40 → 123.4) but still sorts correctly using numbers.
    
    ### Example Usage for Sales Analytics:
        WITH base_data AS (
          SELECT
            Brand,
            City,
            ROUND(SUM(Settle_Total), 2) AS total_revenue_num,
            COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
          FROM `sales_table`
          GROUP BY Brand, City
        )
        SELECT
          Brand,
          City,
          REGEXP_REPLACE(
            FORMAT('%.2f', total_revenue_num),
            r'(\.\d*?[1-9])0+$|\.0+$',
            r'\1'
          ) AS total_revenue,
          transaction_count
        FROM base_data
        ORDER BY total_revenue_num DESC

    ---

    This approach keeps formatting clean **without affecting sorting accuracy**, which was the issue in your previous query.

    

    ##Thought Process to Follow

    1. **Understand the intent** of the question (e.g., trend, count, percentage) from the information provided in **Metadata Section**.
    2. Decide on appropriate **filters**, **aggregations**, and **binning** operations.
    3. Use **CTEs or subqueries** to structure complex logic cleanly.
    4. Compose the final query using clean SQL syntax.

    ---

    ##Response Format (MANDATORY)

    - Format your entire SQL inside a code block with `sql`:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM {table_name} ORDER BY date_column DESC LIMIT 10
      ```

    - Do **NOT** include any explanations, comments, or extra text—**just the SQL**.
