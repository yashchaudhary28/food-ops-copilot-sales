Food-Ops-Copilot - Sales Analytics

A GenAI-powered SQL copilot application for restaurant sales data analysis using BigQuery and Chainlit. This deployment is specifically optimized for sales transaction analysis with comprehensive payment, tax, and geographic insights.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The application is built around a natural language to SQL conversion pipeline with these key components:

Core Components
app.py
 - Chainlit Chat Interface
Interactive web-based chat UI using Chainlit framework
Handles user messages and displays SQL results
Integrates with BigQuery for data export
Uses toggle buttons for SQL/metadata visibility
main.py
 - Entry Point & Processing Engine
Supports 3 modes: single question, batch processing, replay
Handles multiprocessing for batch operations
Orchestrates the entire question-to-answer pipeline
sql_agent.py
 - Core NL-to-SQL Engine
Uses Vertex AI Gemini models for SQL generation
Implements few-shot learning with examples
Handles schema understanding and query validation
Integrates with reflection and embedding components
Supporting Modules
reflection_agent.py
 - Query validation and improvement
embedding_model.py
 - Semantic similarity for few-shot examples
chat_history_manager.py
 - Conversation context management
config.py
 - GCP and application configuration
prompt.py
 - Prompt templates for the AI models
